# Speech-to-Text Using Python

This project demonstrates how to convert speech to text using the Python `SpeechRecognition` library along with `pydub` for handling audio files.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Converts speech from an audio file into text using pre-trained speech recognition engines.
- **Audio Processing**: Uses `pydub` to preprocess and handle audio input.
- **Simple and Quick Setup**: The code initializes the speech recognizer and processes the audio file to output the recognized text.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `SpeechRecognition`
- `pydub`

You can install these using the following command:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pydub
```

## How It Works

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   The notebook installs necessary dependencies (`SpeechRecognition` and `pydub`) for recognizing and processing speech from an audio source.

    ```python
    !pip install SpeechRecognition pydub
    ```

2. **Initialize Recognizer**:
   A recognizer instance from the `SpeechRecognition` library is created, which will be used to convert the audio to text.

    ```python
    import speech_recognition as sr
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    ```

3. **Process Audio Input**:
   The audio input is provided, and the recognizer listens to the audio file and processes it using the underlying speech recognition engine.

4. **Speech to Text**:
   The audio is processed, and the corresponding text is outputted by the speech recognizer.

## Usage

1. **Audio Input**:
   Provide an audio file that contains the speech you want to convert to text. Make sure the file format is supported (e.g., `.wav`, `.mp3`).

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   Simply run the cells in the notebook to install dependencies and run the speech recognition process.

## Output

Once the audio is processed, the notebook outputs the transcribed text, providing a textual representation of the speech in the audio file.

## Example

Here is a simple example of how the process works:

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

# Initialize recognizer
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

# Load the audio file
audio_file = "path_to_audio_file.wav"

# Convert speech to text
with sr.AudioFile(audio_file) as source:
    audio = recognizer.record(source)
    text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
    print(f"Recognized Text: {text}")
```

## Conclusion

This notebook is a simple implementation of speech recognition in Python. It demonstrates how to convert speech to text using readily available libraries. You can further enhance this project by integrating other speech engines or processing larger datasets for transcription.
